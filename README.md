# Machine Learning Beginner Course

This repository contains various notebooks and Python files developed as part of a beginner Machine Learning course taught by seniors at my college. The course covered foundational concepts and practical implementations of neural networks, GANs, and other ML models.  

## Overview  

### 1. GANs (`gans/` folder):  
Implementations of popular Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) such as:  
- `FashionMNISTGan.ipynb` - GAN trained on FashionMNIST dataset.  
- `cifarGAN.py` - GAN for CIFAR-10 dataset.  
- `cycleGAN.py` - Implementation of CycleGAN.  
- `sineGAN.py` - Implementation of GAN generating sine wave data.

### 2. Jupyter Notebooks (`in order jupyter/` folder):  

#### CNNs and Neural Networks:  
- `CNNs(1)_intro_book.ipynb` - Introduction to CNNs from a foundational perspective.  
- `NeuralNetworksFromScratchwithRegularization.ipynb` - Implementing neural networks from scratch with regularization techniques.  
- `Neural_Networks_From_Scratch.ipynb` - Another implementation of neural networks from scratch.  
- `nn_from_scratch.py` & `nn_from_scratch_Metal_Mac_Support.py` - Python scripts for custom neural network implementations with Mac compatibility.  

#### RNN & LSTM:  
- `RNN_LSTM_NeuralNetsUnleashed.ipynb` - Learning about RNNs and LSTMs for sequential data.  

#### Optimization:  
- `elastic_net_chhatGPT.ipynb` - Working with Elastic Net regularization.  

#### Assignments:  
- `Assignment_Oct.ipynb`, `assignment_oct29_test.ipynb` - Coursework assignments.  
- `CNN_Fashion_mnist_assgn_29Oct.ipynb` - Assignment focused on Fashion MNIST classification using CNNs.  

#### Other Files:  
- `tiktokten.ipynb` - Possibly an experimental or fun project.  
- `tried_different_things.ipynb` - Notebook exploring various concepts or debugging.
